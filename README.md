After several years of secondary development based on Tair, we decided to redevelop a distributed KV storage system as our needs, and the Nubase appeared. Nubase is developed with C++ 11;  it is widely used in recommendation/search business and other common businesses in production.

Nubase has a similar design of architecture to Tair, and some other features are required for the real-world use cases in our business;  we believe those features are beneficial for others outside as well.
